============================================= iDEA =======================================

1.  Allow patients to search for doctors of various specializations (family doctor, cardiologist,
    podiatrist, etc.) by location.

2.  Show doctor's initials AND consulting fee( cheap as possible ) AND if patient want to book appointment show fee for that too.

3.  Doctor's whole profile ( with certs, degree, etc...)

4.  consulting service ( Q/A type ) - Ques send to all doctor, if any free then will answer

5.  takeCare service - If patient comes out to be a COVID +ve, then proving them regular checkup reminders, 
    precautions ( he/she should take ), if things goes out of control provide transferring service to nearby
    inlist ( which obv would be best ) hospital, ...ADD MORE :(  

    
============================================== FrontEnd Proto ===============================

after login what happens ->

HOME_PAGE : - ( only for Patient ) if first time user have come then opens with a modal or as you wish, with a BOT ( which
              will take your health status and send that to back-end )
              so according to the status we may display services
              as if positive => is applicable to both services (takeCare service & appointmentBook service)
              and if negative => is applicable to appointment service only
            - now other than BOT what we can keep in HOMEPAGE ?
              can show our services and redirects to them also

now I was thinking of tabs what what we can keep ?
"service tab" -- ( only for Patient ) -- showing services available to patient
"Q/A tab" -- (for both doc n patient ) -- showing questions asked with search bar + create question ( only for Patient )( if 
              question already present then show old questions similar to that )
"News tab" -- (for both doc n patient ) showing news updates
"Appointments tab" -- (will be different UI for both patient and doctor accordingly) -- Doctor can see appoints coming
                       and patient can have a platform to book a appointment to a certain doctor
"MORE TABS COMING ;)"
